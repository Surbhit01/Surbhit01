## :man_technologist: Projects:

### Home Loan Prediction
Predict if the home loan application request should be accepted or not based of several factors like gender, property type, applicant income etc. Performed necessary data preprocessing like mapping, one hot encoding and trained random forest classifier for the prediction. [View Project Here](https://github.com/Surbhit01/HomeLoanPrediction)

### Potato Disease Prediction
Image classification problem where the main goal is to identify if the potato leaf image is infected or not. There are 3 possible classifications ‚Äì Early blight, Late blight and Healthy. Convolution Neural Network architecture for training the model. The model was hosted locally using flask. [View Project Here](https://github.com/Surbhit01/Potato-Disease)

### Insurance Fraud detection
The aim of this project is to build a classification model to detect if a vehicle insurance claim made by the customer is fraudulent or not. 30+ features like education level, months as customer, umbrella limit, accident severity etc were analyzed from the dataset an predictions were made. Performed hyper parameter tuning on algorithms like Support Vector Classifier, XGBoost and Random Forest Classifier.[View Project Here](https://github.com/Surbhit01/InsuranceFraudDetection)

### Text Sentiment Classification
Sentiment classification problem where a phrase/sentence will be taken as input and its sentiment will be predicted - either positive or negative. This has been trained on 7900+ tweets from twitter. I have performed text preprocessing like stopword removal, lemmetization, removing special characters etc. Used tfidf vectorizer and logistic regression for modelling. Performed hyper parameter tuning to tune the model performance.
